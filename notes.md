- We can create a wrapper component with a status bar, a safe area view, something like that, but I prefer to repeat it every time in the different \_layout.tsx files.

- For the future, I should probably use NativeWind as it provides responsive design by itself, without having to rely on this sketchy tricks.

- I did a tutorial on the UberClone, I used a package to create the onboarding carousel, if I can't find it then use the notjustdev tutorial.

- At then end of both register and login pages, I should add a little separator line and then a login with Google button, make it white and with a logo a the left.

- I should implement dark and light mode, the default template comes with that so I should check it.

- I should make custom alerts, and make them more intuitive.

- Add haptics on touch and on response to actions is quite cool

- As I can't run the app on the physical device due to not having an Apple Developer account, I could make a fork without a development build, so not using react-native-firebase and just to test the UI.

- For the onboarding carousel I need to get the assets from somewhere, and also I'd love to make them like move, I saw a tutorial on "Code with Nomi"

- Also, at the end of the onboarding, I'd love an animation where like it joins everything into a whirl, like it creates your personalised profile or something
